Big Mail Labeler

This simple script connects to your IMAP mailbox, searches through the given
IMAP folder (usually one that contains all messages, but it does not have to)
and uses IMAP COPY command to label them. In Gmail (and Google Apps of course)
this command actually causes a label to be added to those messages.

You can then conveniently click on the label and see just the big messages and
decide which ones are important and which ones are weird photos in BMP from
your very distant relative.

Note that for regular, non-gmail IMAP mailboxes, you might want to use
--no-label flag to avoid copying emails.

This script requires IMAPClient, a convenient Python IMAP library.

You can install it using PyPI:
    (sudo) pip install imapclient

or EasyInstall:
    (sudo) easy_install IMAPClient
